            I am a proud South African, born and bred.

            In 2015, I began my tertiary education at the University of Cape
            Town. In 2019, I graduated with an Honours degree, majoring in
            Computer Science and Computer Games Development.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            I have now been working professionally as a Software Engineer for 4
            years. I am currently working in the FinTech sector, focusing on
            developing state of the art web-services to facilitate distribution
            of terminal configuration to merchant retail stores over the
            internet. There is a chance you have used my code without realizing
            it!

          <p className="paragraph">
            I began my programming journey creating server plugins in Java for
            the popular video game, Minecraft in my free time outside of school.
            The server running my code went on to become one of the top 5
            servers worldwide by number of concurrent players. It was at this
            time that my &apos;code-brain&apos; unlocked, and I knew there and
            then that this was what I was meant to do.
          </p>
          <p className="paragraph">
            I have a passion for learning and extreme drive for success.
            Programming has become a large part of my life; I find great
            pleasure in learning about, designing, engineering, and delivering
            cutting-edge software products across a wide range of platforms,
            some of which include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span className="list-text">Web apps and microservices</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="list-text">Mobile</span>

            When I&apos;m not at the computer with 20+ Google Chrome tabs open
            during a debug session, you may find me at the beach, on the slopes
            of the alps, grabbing a beer on a night out with friends, or playing
            my favourite video games.
